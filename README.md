Name: Calvin The Calculator

Authors: Joe Ramos, George Alenchery

Description: This is a menu driven C++ program created as part of my Programming I course. The program introduces users to a simple interactive system that can perform multiple calculation tasks based on user selection. The user is greeted by calvin and prompted to choose between calculating the area of a shape, computing GPA, or performing basic arithmetic.

Purpose: The purpose of this project was to demonstrate foundational C++ programming concepts learned in Programming I. This includes functions, classes, conditionals, user input, and basic program flow through a menu driven interface.
